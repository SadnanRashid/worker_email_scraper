# Advanced Email, Phone and Social Media Scraper

### Overview

The **Advanced Email, Phone and Social Media Scraper** is an advanced tool for gathering contact and social media information from websites. With a unique, human-emulating approach, it effectively bypasses common security blocks, including CAPTCHA and Cloudflare, enabling reliable, efficient data extraction. Simply provide a single URL or list of URLs, and this scraper will dive deep into each site, navigating to areas most likely to contain contact details while skipping irrelevant pages to conserve resources.

### Key Features

-   **Full Contact Data Extraction**: Collects emails, phone numbers, and social media links from any website, making your data collection process efficient and thorough.

-   **Human-Emulation Browsing**: Bypasses security measures by navigating each site with a Chrome browser, providing more consistent access even in security-sensitive environments.

-   **Smart Resource Management**: Efficiently retrieves emails, phone numbers, and social media links by focusing only on high-potential pages within a website, ignoring subpages with a low likelihood of containing contact information. This approach saves time and resources while still ensuring comprehensive data collection.

-   **Bulk URL Processing**: Supports single or multiple URLs in one run, making it ideal for both small-scale and large-scale projects.

### How It Works

1. **Input URLs**: Add the target URLs (formatted as `https://domain.com`) or upload a list for bulk processing.

2. **Selective Page Crawling**: The worker scans each website’s main pages and subpages likely to contain contact details, skipping lower-relevance areas to optimize for efficiency.

3. **Contact Extraction**:
    - **Comprehensive Crawling**: The worker scans accessible areas, checking potential sources of contact details.
    - **Data Retrieval**: Captures available emails, phone numbers, and the first valid social media links it identifies (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, Pinterest, Instagram).
4. **Data Storage**: Saves all data in Apify’s dataset format, allowing easy export for analysis or integration with other workflows.
